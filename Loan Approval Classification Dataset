Split the data into train and testing part using an 80:20 splitting ratio. Apply appropriate feature scaling and
encoding techniques to each column of the data so that they can be fed into a machine learning model for the
purpose of classification. Moreover, to apply above mentioned pre-processing techniques you need to use
the concept of column transformer and pipelines.
2. In the second half of the assignment, you are supposed to apply logistic regression and decision tree classifier
to the data with and without pre-processing and analyze the obtained classification results.
You have to submit:
1. Properly commented and indented python code you have written for the preprocessing of the dataset.
2. Analysis of the classification results obtained for decision tree and logistic regression model and discuss
your finding and conclusions you have deduced from the results.
